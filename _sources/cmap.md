# CMAP

## Overview

The CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) includes monthly and pentad global gridded precipitation means.
It has a standard version and one enhanced with NCEP Reanalysis.
CMAP covers from 1979 to near the present on a global grid at 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree longitude resolution.
For more information you can check the original data source on the
[NOAA Physical Sceince Laboratory (PSL) website](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html)
and the [UCAR climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/cmap-cpc-merged-analysis-precipitation)
for a review of the dataset.

## Data download

The [original data](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/global_precip/html/wpage.cmap.html)
is created by NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and it is in ascii format;
we download a netcdf version from [PSL](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html).
For this reason the PSL data is updated irregularly, following updates at CPC.

The download script uses wget. It can be run as follows,
```
$ ./cmap_download.sh <file> <subset>
```
where  <subset> is `enh` for enhanced and `std` for standard.

## Data location

We've downloaded the CMAP dataset to:
```
/g/data/ia39/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/cmap/data 
```

There are two sub-folders:

`enh` for enhanced monthly data:
- `precip.mon.ltm.nc`: enhanced long term monthly mean, derived from years 1981 to 2010
- `precip.mon.mean.nc`: enhanced monthly mean from 1979/01 to 2021/03
- `precip.pentad.mean.nc`: enhanced pentad mean from 1979/01 to 2016/12/27

`std` for standard monthly data:
- `precip.mon.ltm.nc`: standard long term monthly mean, derived from years 1981 to 2010
- `precip.mon.mean.nc`: standard monthly mean from 1979/01 to 2021/03
- `precip.pentad.mean.nc`: standard pentad mean from 1979/01 to 2016/12/27

The `update_log.txt` file keeps track of remote and local updates to files.
The previously downloaded version is kept for reference in the `previous_version` sub-folders.

## Author note

We would also appreciate receiving a copy of the relevant publications.
This will help PSL to justify keeping the CMAP Precipitation data set freely available online in the future.
Thank you!
