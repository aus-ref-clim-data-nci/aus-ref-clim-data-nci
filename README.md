## Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection @ NCI  

### What is it? 

A collaboration between the Australian Climate Service (ACS),
ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX)
and the wider Australian climate research community
to re-establish and maintain a reference dataset collection at NCI. 

### Background 

Observational and reanalysis datasets are important to many areas of weather, climate and ocean research.
There is significant overlap between the datasets required by researchers at the Bureau of Meteorology
CSIRO and Australian universities, so there have been efforts over the years
to establish and maintain a shared reference dataset collection at NCI.
Some high profile datasets are actively managed as stand alone projects
(e.g. ERA5 in project rt52, AGCD in zv2, BARRA in ma05/cj37),
but the most recent effort to maintain a broader reference dataset collection
(project rr7, which was coordinated by NCI) has been inactivate for the past few years.
During that period, the Computational Modelling Support (CMS) team at CLEX
(led in this space by Paola Petrelli) have been maintaining a number of reference datasets
for their own researchers and other ad hoc efforts have been happening here and there.
With the establishment of the ACS, there is a need (and opportunity) to re-establish
a shared reference dataset collection.
By setting up a formal collaboration between the ACS and CLEX we can leverage
the existing code/expertise at CLEX and the dedicated ACS shared storage space at NCI
to deliver such a collection. 

### Who's involved? 

- Damien Irving, Chloe Mackallah and Claire Trenham from ACS 
- Paola Petrelli from CLEX 
- Other ACS/CLEX staff and community members as required 

### Which datasets?

We've put together a [short survey](https://forms.gle/4BiXS3wtEPAwCgA6A)
to collect information from the Australian climate research community about the datasets
(and variables and timescales within those datasets)
people would like to see included in the collection.
We won't be able to support every dataset,
but we'll do our best to support those that are widely requested.

### Access

The collection will be hosted in [project ia39](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ia39) on NCI.
When the collection goes live (date TBC),
access will be open to anyone in the Australian climate research community.
