# Comms for aus-ref-clim-data-nci 


### Soft launch of the Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection @ NCI
We are pleased to announce the soft launch of the the [Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection @ NCI](https://aus-ref-clim-data-nci.github.io/aus-ref-clim-data-nci), a collaboration between the Australian Climate Service (ACS) and ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX) to re-establish and maintain a reference dataset collection at NCI.

The goal of this collection is to collate and share reference climate datasets that are of high value to the Australian weather, climate and ocean research community, but are otherwise absent from existing NCI collections, or have become inactive and out of date (e.g. [rr7](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/rr7)). Initially, the collection contains precipitation datasets that were previously available in [ua8](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ua8), and the CMIP6 ETCCDI dataset (temperature and precipitation extreme indices derived from CMIP6 data).  
This collection will grow over time, and we have prepared a [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGI0lQMoA3zjOwBtWrr6y_sHrue3CndzhlPHJ38LTEoru_0Q/viewform) to find out which datasets the community would most like to see included in the collection. 

You can [read more](https://aus-ref-clim-data-nci.github.io/aus-ref-clim-data-nci) about the collection, [check out the code repository](https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci) on Github, or start accessing the data in the NCI [project ia39](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ia39) either directly (`/g/data/ia39/aus-ref-clim-data-nci`) or programatically using our Python [intake catalogue](https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/acs-replica-intake).

If you have queries, or would like to contribute your skills to this project, please contact [Damien Irving](mailto:damien.irving@csiro.au) or [Paola Petrelli](mailto:paola.petrelli@utas.edu.au).
