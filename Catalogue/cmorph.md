# CMORPH

## Overview


## Data download

The data is downloaded from the [RDA data server](https://rda.ucar.edu/data/ds502.2/). 
Updates are run regularly via the [accessdev Jenkins server](https://accessdev.nci.org.au/jenkins/job/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/job/CMORPH/). 
The code used is python based and it is a modification of a RDA server download code. 
To see all the options:
    python cmorph.py --help
A record of updates is kept in `update_log.txt`.
