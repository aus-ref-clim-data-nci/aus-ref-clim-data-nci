# MSWEP

## Overview

We have replicated the monthly, daily, and 3hourly Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (mswep) data from GloH2O.

MSWEP is a global precipitation product with a 0.1° resolution available from 1979 - 2020. The product is unique in that it merges gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data to obtain the highest quality precipitation estimates at every location. MSWEP incorporates daily gauge observations and accounts for gauge reporting times to reduce temporal mismatches between satellite-reanalysis estimates and gauge observations. MSWEP is compatible with GloH2O’s operational Multi-Source Weather (MSWX); MSWX forecasts can thus be used to extend MSWEP into the future. MSWEP tends to exhibit better performance than other precipitation products in both densely gauged and ungauged regions (see [Beck et al., 2017](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/21/6201/2017/), and [Beck et al., 2019](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/23/207/2019/)).

This is an extract of the dataset description from the [website](https://www.gloh2o.org/)
where you can find more information on this data. We replicated only the historical precipitation data, if the realtime data is required then please open a new issue in  https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/mswep/issues

## Data download

The data is downloaded from a google drive hosted by https://www.gloh2o.org. The data is monthly, daily, and 3hourly historical data from 1979 - 2020.

The script uses rclone, to run: 

```bash
bash mswep.sh -f <freq>
```

Where `<freq>` is mon, day, or 3hr.

The code used to concatenate the files is a bash script calling CDO:

```bash
bash mswep_concat.sh -f <freq>
```

## Data location

We've downloaded the MSWEP netCDF data to:
```
/g/data/ia39/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/mswep/data/<freq>/mswep_v280_<freq>_<year>.nc
```

Where `<freq>` is mon, day, or 3hr; `<year>` is a year in the range 1979 - 2020. The Monthly & Daily data has been concatenated into yearly files, whereas the 3hourly data has been concatenated into monthly files.
