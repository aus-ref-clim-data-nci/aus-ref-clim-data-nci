# GPCP

## Overview

The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP),
produced by the NASA Mesoscale Atmospheric Processes Laboratory,
comprises threee products: one-degree daily (1DD), monthly product and pentad data.

We have downloaded the following products:
- daily v1.3: this is available up to a three months from present date and it is the recommended daily version
- monthly v2.3: which is the recommended monthly version, goes up to present date, contains some preliminary files

The GPCP One-Degree Daily Precipitation Data Set (1DD Data Set) provides daily,
global 1x1-deg gridded fields of precipitation totals for October 1996 through the delayed present.
The 1DD draws upon several different data sources, surface and satellite measurements, covering different areas of the globe.
This product is updated sporadically, about once a month.

More information is available from the [GPCP webpage](https://precip.gsfc.nasa.gov).
Detailed documentation is also available from the NCEI data server for
[v1-3 daily](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-precipitation-climatology-project-gpcp-daily/doc/) and
[v2.3 monthly](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-precipitation-climatology-project-gpcp-monthly/doc/).
These documents are also available on the filesystem in the dataset folder.

## Data download

We downloaded v1.3 daily and v2-3 monthly from the
[NCEI server](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-precipitation-climatology-project-gpcp-daily/access/), using a python based code.
The code uses the requests module to download the files.

To run it:
```
python gpcp.py -y <year> -t <frequency>
```
To see all the options:
```
python gpcp.py --help
```

Weekly updates are managed via the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/GPCP/actions/workflows/gpcp.yml).


## Data location

We've downloaded GPCP data to:

```
/g/data/ia39/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/gpcp/data/<frequency>/<version>/<YYYY>/<files>
```
where `<frequency>` is `mon` or `day` and
`<version>` is `v1-2` and `v1-3` for daily data and `v2-3` for monthly.

Files are in netcdf4 format and filenames are respectively:
- `gpcp_1dd_v1.2_p1d.YYYYMMDD.nc` for v1.2 daily,
  where the date is the represented day,
  for example: `gpcp_1dd_v1.2_p1d.199610.nc`
- `gpcp_v01r03_daily_dYYYYMMDD_cYYYYMMDD.nc` for v1.3 daily,
  where the first date is the represented day and the second is the creation date for the file,
  for example: `gpcp_v01r03_daily_d20170323_c20171211.nc`
- `gpcp_v02r03_monthly_dYYYYMMDD_cYYYYMMDD.nc`, same conventions as for daily v1.3

If preliminary files are present (currently applies only to v2.3 monthly)
then this is indicated in the filenames as in this example:
```
gpcp_v02r03-preliminary_monthly_d201908_c20190910.nc
```

**NB:** We've now concatenated the V1-3 daily data into yearly files, they are located at:

```
/g/data/ia39/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/gpcp/data/day_concat/<files>
```
Files are in netcdf4 format and filenames are `gpcp_v01r03_daily_YYYY.nc` for v1.3 daily.
